## Description

Tumblr scarping takes place in three stages:

The artifacts from each stage is cached, so every stage can be interrupted/resumed without needing to re-run the previous stage.

## Reference

### Sequence

### Details

1. **Scarp** post data from Tumblr API + cache to `*.json` files on disk
  - Paginates API data into paginated json files
  - Idempotent: cached API data is not queried on subsequent runs
2. **Normalize** post metadata for each image, cache results to `*.yaml` files on disk
  - uses `*.json` files cached from API scrape during stage 1
  For each image:
    1. Determine best image URL to download
    2. Normalize tags into XMP-ready taxonomy
3. **Download + Tag** image files
  - Uses `*.yaml` file(s) created/cached during stage 2
  - For each image:
    1. Download image file
    2. Tag image file with XMP tags based on the post metadata
      * uses [ExiftTool][1]
      * post metadata = tags


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
